In this folder you should add 

- A font: I choose Ubuntu-R.ttf
- A file named constants.py containing the following variables:
    * `api_key = "**************"`                                      
      Generated by immich. Should have these permissions: album.read, asset.view, asset.read
    * `api_endpoint = "http://<immich host : port>/api"`                
      Api url of your immich instance 
    * `album_id = "<uuid of the album shown in the picture frame>"`               
      An album shared or owned by the user that generated the api key  
    * `data_path_outside_docker = "/path/to/data/library"`              
      If the program runs on the very same machine hosting immich, we can access the files directly instead of pulling thumbnails from the immich api
